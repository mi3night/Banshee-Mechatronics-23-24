//Goal: Full functionallity using both ultrasonic sensor and get information from raspberry pi to tell Arduino Nano when to move

//General Notes:
If the code doesnt compile on the first run Go to Tools -> Processor -> Use ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)
To make the code work the ESCs need to be in option 2 run mode

FOR BTP ONLY
int midpoint = 90;
int curr_speed = 90;
int break_point = 85;
int forward_speed = 98;
int reverse_speed = 76;

So in the code, you need to make a function that overrides brake mode as follows:
Send 80-90 degrees to the pod to make it brake. Do not send 0. If i remember correctly, these ESCs are kind of 
violent, and 0 or 180 will send the pod flying in one direction or another.
From this point, use the gradient descent function to gradually increase the value back to your midpoint. 
For example, if your calibrated center point was at 92, and your brake degree is at 80, then your function would 
send the following information to the ESC with a 50ms delay in between: 80 -> 81 -> 82 -> 83 -> 84 -> ... -> 92
Once the control point is set back to 92, or the midpoint, then use the gradient descent back in the other direction 
to send the pod backwards. 92 -> 91 -> 90 -> .. you get the point

"Forward" and "Backward" is arbitarty for now

91 good midpoint for left side
