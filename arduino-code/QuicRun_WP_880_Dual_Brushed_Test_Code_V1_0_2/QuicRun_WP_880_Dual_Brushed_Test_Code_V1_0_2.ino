//Goal: Add reset pin control so raspberry pi can control when the arduino code can run

TODO:
remove updates from comments and make an update log txt file or something like that along with a resource doc and readme
Matt: maybe make header files to keep code cleaner
readd vcc control
clean upcode ie make comments uniform, remove debugging print statements, make naming conventions and formatting conistant
Jin: Make a default or reset pod function to always be at the "start postion" (the GCS side of the rail)start direction at 0 by default rather than 1 since the rpi should be controlling the pod movement
  make sure that pod starts at no movement and check if its in the right spot

Alex: change serial read from pi to be only positive ints only since the string to int conversion cannot process the "-" sign possibly switch to string input only?

GCS Request Battery Sends singal to BTP RPI -> BTP RPI sends signal to arm for extraction -> BTP RPI sends signal to the BTP Arduino to move to BVM -> BTP moves to BVM -> BVM Already in empty state 
-> BTP Arduino signals to BTP RPI its at BVM -> BTP RPI inputs battery into empty slot of BVM -> BVM roates to new battery -> BTP RPI Arm Cam looks for AR Mark -> BTP RPI ARM grabs battery
-> BTP RPI sends singal to BTP Arduino to go to GCS -> BTP moves to GCS -> BTP Arduino singals to BTP RPI its at GCS -> BTP RPI inserts battery into Drone -> rinse and repeat

Updates:
V1.0 Updates
10/04/23
Added serial output 's' to BTP RPI that it has stopped
Switch serial input if statements to be chars instead of postive ints only GCS = 'g' BVM = 'b'
Switch serial input if statements to be positive ints only GCS = 1 BVM = 2

10/03/23
Added python Serial input from Shawn's code testing
Commented out old test code
Added pin declerations for left and right esc and updated comments so it matches pcb
Updated led names to match PCB description
Added LED meanings
10/02/23
Added code to test out the pod movement without rasberry pi input
V0.9 Updates
10/02/23
Changed pinouts to match the PCB
//General Notes:
Possiblely need streaming.h but from light research it just changes how to take in IO streams of data "C++-style Output with Operator"

If the code doesnt compile on the first run Go to Tools -> Processor -> Use ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)
To make the code work the ESCs need to be in option 2 run mode

LED Meanings
Blue ON  Green ON  => Setup
Blue ON  Green OFF => Forward
Blue OFF Green ON  => Reverse
Blue OFF Green OFF => Stopped

FOR BTP ONLY
int midpoint = 90;
int curr_speed = 90;
int break_point = 85;
int forward_speed = 98;
int reverse_speed = 76;

So in the code, you need to make a function that overrides brake mode as follows:
Send 80-90 degrees to the pod to make it brake. Do not send 0. If i remember correctly, these ESCs are kind of 
violent, and 0 or 180 will send the pod flying in one direction or another.
From this point, use the gradient descent function to gradually increase the value back to your midpoint. 
For example, if your calibrated center point was at 92, and your brake degree is at 80, then your function would 
send the following information to the ESC with a 50ms delay in between: 80 -> 81 -> 82 -> 83 -> 84 -> ... -> 92
Once the control point is set back to 92, or the midpoint, then use the gradient descent back in the other direction 
to send the pod backwards. 92 -> 91 -> 90 -> .. you get the point
